        <h1>THE RAREST LOL SKINS AND HOW THEY WERE ACQUIRED</h1>
        <p>Rocking a fancy skin in League of Legends can boost your confidence, but certain skins will make you stand out on Summoner’s Rift—especially when flashing one of the rarest skins out there.</p>
        <p>The newest skins and their fresh effects have their appeal, but they have nothing on unobtainable stuff from back in the day that only very few accounts have unlocked. Those skins, stemming from the very early days of LoL, aren’t just a nostalgic kick: they’re also extremely rare, especially as some of their owners may have gone inactive.</p>

        <h2>The rarest LoL skins: PAX skins</h2>
        <p>Each upcoming rare skin has its own history and reasons for its rarity. Some are exclusive skins from events throughout the years, whereas others were given out to players who joined the game in its infant stages.</p>
        <p>Without further ado, here are the rarest skins in League of Legends and how they were acquired.</p><br>
        <hr>
        <h2>First of all, PAX skins;</h2>
        <hr><br>
        <h2>Twisted Fate PAX</h2>
        <p>Twisted Fate PAX is the first PAX skin that was given to those who attended the PAX event in 2009. Who were the lucky ones who got the skin? Well, about 20,000 people went to the Penny Arcade Expo, better known by the acronym PAX.</p>
        <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-FfUu_b3riw/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="PAX TWISTES FATE" class="image-fist">
        <p>‖ PAX TWISTES FATE ‖</p>
        <p>The Twisted Fate PAX skin codes cost around $450 after the event ended. All unused codes for the Twisted Fate PAX skin were disabled. Nowadays the price of this skin has heighten to $600 and oviously, through the years this will augment.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Jax PAX</h2>
        <p>Twisted Fate wasn't the only one to have a PAX skin. In 2010, a code for the Jax PAX skin was given away to those who attended the event. It is not known how many codes they gave for this skin, but it couldn't have been many, since it is one of the rarest skins in LoL and it´s hard to see it in-game. </p>

        <p>‖ Jax PAX ‖</p>
        <p>Jax PAX is another PAX skin that would make you rich. Seriously, there are people who would pay right now three hundred dollars to have an account with this skin. Does anyone remember the password to their League of Legends account from 2011?</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Sivir PAX</h2>
        <p>Sivir also received a PAX skin. This took place at the Penny Arcade Expo in 2011. The skin is a reference to the Tron movie. Like Jax PAX and Twisted Fate PAX, the codes for this skin were disabled in 2014.</p>
        <img src="https://prod.assets.earlygamecdn.com/images/PAX-Sivir-rare-skins-LoL.jpeg?transform=article3x_webp" alt="Sivir PAX" class="image-fist">
        <p>‖ Sivir PAX ‖</p>
        <p>In 2017, Riot Games released an updated version of Sivir PAX, known as Sivir Neo PAX that uses the same model of the original Sivir PAX, but with improved colors. This skin is ultra rare, nevertheless, it is available in the LoL store.</p>
