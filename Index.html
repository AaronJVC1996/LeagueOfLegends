                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired 
                    by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, 
                    League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. <br> <br> The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

                    In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls 
                    a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within. </p>

                                Players work with their team to break the enemy Nexus before the enemy team breaks theirs. League of
                                Legends is <br> a complex game which  involves both high-level strategy and fast-paced gameplay. Skilled
                                players know how to beat <br> the opponent in front of them, while keeping themacro-elements in mind to
                                support their team to victory.
