        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <blockquote>
            Players work with their team to break the enemy Nexus before the enemy team breaks theirs. League of
            Legends is a complex game which involves both high-level strategy and fast-paced gameplay. Skilled
            players know how to beat the opponent in front of them, while keeping the macro-elements in mind to
            support their team to victory.</blockquote>
