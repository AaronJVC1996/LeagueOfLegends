            League of Legends (LoL) is a popular online strategy game developed and published by Riot Games.<br/>
            It offers a variety of game modes, each with its own focus and dynamics.<br/>
            Here I'll mention some of the most prominent game modes:
        </p>

<br/>
    <div>
        <p>
            Classic/Ranked: This is the main mode of League of Legends.<br/>
            It's played on the classic Summoner's Rift map, where two teams of five players compete to destroy the enemy base, known as the Nexus.<br/>
            Players choose a champion from a wide cast of characters, each with unique abilities, and work together to secure objectives, eliminate enemies, and win the match.
        </p>
    </div>
<br/>
    <div>
        <p>
            ARAM (All Random All Mid): In this mode, players are randomly assigned a champion and face off on a single lane on the Howling Abyss map.<br/>
            The goal is to destroy the enemy tower and ultimately the Nexus.<br/>
            ARAM is faster and more chaotic than the classic mode and focuses on continuous team fights.
        </p>
    </div>
<br/>
    <div>
        <p>
            Twisted Treeline: This is a smaller map than Summoner's Rift, designed for 3v3 matches.<br/>
            Teams battle for control of two altars that provide temporary bonuses, as well as to destroy enemy towers and Nexus.<br/>
            Twisted Treeline offers a faster-paced gameplay experience focused on action.
        </p>
    </div>
<br/>
    <div>
        <p>
            URF Mode (Ultra Rapid Fire): URF is a special game mode offered periodically and for a limited time.<br/>
            In URF, champions' abilities have extremely reduced cooldowns, allowing for fast-paced and action-packed gameplay.<br/>
            Players can use their abilities almost constantly, leading to frantic skirmishes and chaotic situations.
        </p>
    </div>
<br/>
    <div>
        <p>
            Practice and Training Mode: League of Legends also offers game modes for practicing and improving skills.<br/>
            These include bot training modes, where players can practice mechanics and strategies,<br/>
            as well as tools like the Practice Tool, which allows players to test champions and builds in a controlled environment.
        </p>
    </div>
<br/>
    <p>
        These are just some of the game modes offered by League of Legends.<br/>
        The variety of modes provides options for different playstyles and experience levels, contributing to the game's enduring popularity.
