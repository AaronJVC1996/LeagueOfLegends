        <h1>Types of champions</h1>
        <p class="color1">Every champion in League of Legends has an assigned class. Classes and their interactions with
            one another influence gameplay pacing and decisions.</p>
        <p class="color1">The available classes are as follows:</p>
        <p class="color1">Marksman<br>
            Controller = Catcher, Enchanter<br>
            Fighter = Diver, Juggernaut<br>
            Mage = Artillery, Battlemage, Burst<br>
            Slayer = Assassin, Skirmisher<br>
            Tank = Vanguard, Warden<br>
            Specialist (or Unclassified)</p>
        <img src="../assets/TiposCampeones.jpg" alt="TiposCampeonesalt">
        <hr>

        <h2>Marksman</h2>
        <p class="color2">Marksmen are ranged champions whose power almost exclusively revolves around their basic
            attacks: using their reach to land massive continuous damage from a distance,
            marksmen are capable of taking down even the toughest of opponents when positioned behind the safety of
            their team, and excel at securing map objectives such as Dragon,
            Baron Nashor and turrets</p>
        <p class="color2">Due to their potent reach and DPS, marksmen are particularly strong against more durable
            opponents, namely fighters and tanks, but fall quickly to the burst damage of assassins and mages</p><br>
        <img src="../assets/AsheRender.jpg" alt="AsheRenderalt" class="image-fist">
        <hr>

        <h2>Controller</h2>
        <p class="color2">Controllers assist their allies with potent utility and keep enemies at bay with crowd
            control. Weak when alone, supports are capable of massively
            amplifying their teammates' power to become the strongest class in group combat (or teamfights), supplying
            crucial utility or crowd control at clutch
            moments to save allies from death and enable takedowns on the enemy team</p>
        <p class="color2">Supports typically start out by assisting the marksman in lane, as their own power is less
            dependent on items to function well,
            but over time their contribution expands as they lend aid to their entire team with both their spells and
            effective, yet affordable,
            items. Sub-classes of Controllers are enchanters and catchers</p><br />
        <h3>Catchers</h3>
        <p class="color3">Catchers specialize in locking down opponents or, in some cases, entire battlefields by
            creating intense zones of threat that only foolish
            enemies would dare wade through. Although not as reliant on their friends as Enchanters, the fragile
            Catchers greatly benefit from allied presence - both
            to deter incoming danger and to help capitalize on targets they've locked down
        <p>
            <img src="../assets/BardRender.jpg" alt="BardRenderalt" class="image-fist"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h3>Enchanters</h3>
        <p class="color3">Enchanters focus on amplifying their allies' effectiveness by directly augmenting them and
            defending them from incoming threats.
            Enchanters themselves are often quite fragile and bring relatively low damage to the table, meaning they
            really only shine when grouped together with others</p>
        <img src="../assets/JannaRender.jpg" alt="JannaRenderalt" class="image-fist">
        <br /><br /><br />
        <hr>

        <h2>Fighter</h2>
        <p class="color2">Fighters (also known as Bruisers) are a diverse group of short-ranged combatants who excel at
            both dealing and surviving damage.
            With easy access to heavy, continuous damage (or DPS) and a host of innate defenses, fighters thrive in
            extended fights as they seek out enemies to take down,
            but their limited range puts them at constant risk of being kept at bay (or kited) by their opponents via
            crowd control, range and mobility</p>
        <p class="color2">Fighters tend to have an advantage against assassins, whose burst tends to fall short of
            killing them when unaided,
            as well as tanks, whose inferior damage allows fighters to eventually defeat them in duels, but often
            struggle against mages and marksmen,
            whose superior reach allows them to kite approaching fighters. Sub-classes of the Fighters are juggernauts,
            and divers</p><br />
        <h3>Divers</h3>
        <p class="color3">Divers are the more mobile portion of the Fighter class. Divers excel at singling out
            high-priority targets to blitz toward,
            immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diverâ€™s presence. Divers are not as
            durable as the tanks
            or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment while bringing enough damage
            to be a real kill threat if left unchecked
        <p>
            <img src="../assets/JarvanIVRender.jpg" alt="JarvanIVRenderalt"
                class="image-fist"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h3>Juggernauts</h3>
        <p class="color3">Juggernauts are melee titans who relentlessly march down the opposition and devastate those
            foolish enough to get within their grasp.
            They are the only subclass who excel at both dealing and taking significant amounts of damage, but in turn
            they have a tough time closing in
            on targets due to their low range and extremely limited mobility</p>
        <img src="../assets/IllaoiRender.jpg" alt="IllaoiRenderalt" class="image-fist">
        <br /><br /><br />
        <hr>

        <h2>Mage</h2>
        <p class="color2">Mages are champions who typically possess great reach, ability-based area of effect damage and
            crowd control, and who use all of these strengths
            in tandem with each other to trap and destroy enemies from a distance. Specializing in magic damage, often
            burst damage, and therefore investing
            heavily in items that allow them to cast stronger and faster spells, mages excel at chaining their abilities
            together in powerful combos in order
            to win fights, though their abilities also tend to be difficult to land and can be mitigated, if not avoided
            completely, by their targets if they react in time</p>
        <p class="color2">Though mages tend to focus on killing prime targets in combat, they can also fall back to
            their innate crowd control and utility to manipulate key opponents,
            protecting their team from them or setting them up for a takedown, and in the right circumstances can damage
            and control multiple enemies at a time.
            In spite of the influence they exert, mages tend to be innately fragile, and fall quickly to direct strikes
        </p>
        <p class="color2">In general, mages are capable of dealing well with marksmen, as their burst can kill them
            before they can return the same amount of damage, and fighters,
            as their crowd control tends to make them excellent kiters. However, they are easily shut down by assassins
            who can often bypass their reach and spells completely,
            and tanks, who can lock them down and soak up their abilities better than other classes. Sub-classes of
            Mages are burst, battle, and artillery Mages</p><br />
        <h3>Artillery</h3>
        <p class="color3">Artillery Mages are the masters of range, and they leverage that advantage to whittle down
            their opponents over time from great distances.
            In turn, Artillery Mages are severely punished when enemies finally succeed in closing in on them, due to
            their extreme fragility and limited mobility
        <p>
            <img src="../assets/VelkozRender.jpg" alt="VelkozRenderalt"
                class="image-fist"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h3>Battlemages</h3>
        <p class="color3">Battlemages (also known as Warlocks) get into the middle of the fray, seeking to wreak havoc
            upon the entire enemy team with their overwhelming
            sustained area damage. Due to their relatively short (but not melee) combat ranges and the need to burn down
            their opponents over time, Battle Mages
            have significant defensive capabilities that range from sustaining endlessly to literally defying death for
            a short period of time</p>
        <img src="../assets/VladimirRender.jpg" alt="VladimirRenderalt"
            class="image-fist"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h3>Burst</h3>
        <p class="color3">Burst Mages aim to single out vulnerable targets by locking them down and following up with a
            devastating barrage of damage from range.
            They are strongest when using their full suite of spells executed perfectly to maximum effect, and most
            vulnerable when they cannot deliver</p>
        <img src="../assets/SyndraRender.jpg" alt="SyndraRenderalt" class="image-fist">
        <br /><br /><br />
        <hr>

        <h2>Slayer</h2>
        <p class="color2">Slayers are highly mobile champions who specialize in single target burst damage. What they
            generally lack in resilience, they more than make up for with
            their ability to quickly cover large distances, kill priority targets and retreat just as fast. Epitomizing
            a high risk, high reward playstyle, assassins
            are natural opportunists and prefer to strike when their targets are alone and vulnerable, rather than
            engage them in a direct assault,
            favoring damage-oriented item builds to capitalize on their offensive capabilities</p>
        <p class="color2">They're particularly effective against softer (or squishy) targets, especially mages and
            marksmen, but often struggle against the heightened defenses of
            fighters and tanks. Subclasses of Slayers are assassins and skirmishers</p><br />
        <h3>Assassins</h3>
        <p class="color3">Assassins specialize in infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly
            dispatch high-priority targets.
            Due to their mostly melee nature, Assassins must put themselves into dangerous positions in order to execute
            their targets.
            Luckily, they often have defensive tricks up their sleeves that, if used cleverly, allow them to effectively
            avoid incoming damage
        <p>
            <img src="../assets/TalonRender.jpg" alt="TalonRenderalt" class="image-fist"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h3>Skirmishers</h3>
        <p class="color3">Skirmishers (also known as Duelists) aim to shred through any nearby enemy that approaches.
            Because Skirmishers lack high-end burst damage
            or reliable ways of closing in on high-priority targets, they are instead armed with situationally powerful
            defensive tools to survive in the fray,
            along with extreme sustained damage to cut down even the most durable targets</p>
        <img src="../assets/JaxRender.jpg" alt="JaxRenderalt" class="image-fist">
        <br /><br /><br />
        <hr>

        <h2>Tank</h2>
        <p class="color2">Tanks are tough melee champions who sacrifice damage in exchange for powerful crowd control.
            While able to engage enemies in combat, a tank's purpose
            isn't usually to kill opponents; rather, tanks excel at disrupting enemies and diverting focus to
            themselves, allowing them to lock down specific targets
            (or several targets at once), as well as remove (or peel) threats from their allies</p>
        <p class="color2">In addition to strong base defenses, tanks generally have a means of amplifying their
            tankiness even further with their abilities, and tend
            to fully invest in defensive items to maximize their resilience. However, tanks lack the tools to truly
            succeed in single combat, and their
            influence is limited by their low overall mobility, preventing them from constantly staying on top of their
            targets</p>
        <p class="color2">As tanks can handle burst damage very well, they tend to succeed against assassins and most
            mages, but their vulnerability to continuous damage
            puts them at a disadvantage against fighters and marksmen. Subcategories of Tanks are vanguards, and wardens
        </p><br />
        <h3>Vanguards</h3>
        <p class="color3">Vanguards are offensive tanks. Vanguards lead the charge for their team and specialize at
            bringing the action.
            Their explosive team fight initiation seeks to catch enemies out of position while allowing allies to
            follow-up to devastating effect
        <p>
            <img src="../assets/LeonaRender.jpg" alt="LeonaRenderalt" class="image-fist"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h3>Wardens</h3>
        <p class="color3">Wardens are defensive tanks. Wardens stand steadfast, seeking to hold the line by persistently
            locking down any on-comers who try to pass them.
            Wardens keep their allies out of harmâ€™s way and allow them to safely deal with enemies caught in the fray
        </p>

        <h2>Specialist (or Unclassified)</h2>
        <p class="color2">Specialists are a diverse group of champions who do not "fit into a neat little box" in
            regards to other class/subclass specifications. The majority of these
            champions were once part of other sub-classes but were reclassified in the V7.10 update, including a large
            number of champions from the former Zoner subclass
            of Controller. As a consequence, many Specialists exhibit "zone control" either as a dominant or secondary
            attribute, including many of the pre-7.10 Specialists</p>
        <p class="color2">A Zone Controller is a champion whose influence is limited either to telegraphed zonesâ€”such as
            Azir's Soldiers and Time Bombâ€”or a persistent threat that is
            dependent on cooldown knowledgeâ€”such as Feast, Chronoshift or Crowstorm. The latter type of Zone Controller
            is comparable in their psychological threat to
            a Juggernaut, except that this threat largely diminishes once the problematic ability is known to be on
            cooldown</p><br />
