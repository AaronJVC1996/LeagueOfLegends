                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena
                    video
                    game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired
                    by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a
                    stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009,
                    League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. <br> <br>
                    The
                    game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

                    In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying
                    and
                    defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls
                    a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a
                    match,
                    champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items
                    to
                    defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to
                    the
                    enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within. </p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    Players work with their team to break the enemy Nexus before the enemy team breaks theirs. League of
                    Legends is <br> a complex game which involves both high-level strategy and fast-paced gameplay.
                    Skilled
                    players know how to beat <br> the opponent in front of them, while keeping themacro-elements in mind
                    to
                    support their team to victory.
